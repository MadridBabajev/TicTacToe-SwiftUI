## About the Project

This project was built in 2022 during the Native Mobile Applications course on my girlfriend's Mac. It was a good introduction to developing software on MacOS and ended up being rather useful, as in a few months I would have to write a significantly bigger project on Mac, since my notebook would break.

To this day, I consider writing UI in SwiftUI being the most convenient and fluent, nothing really surpassed that feeling for me despite me having experience in numerous technologies having written UI in React, Vite, Flutter, Android, etc.

This is a simple application that allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against another player locally, or against a computer with various difficulties. The application has multiple views and navigation, reusable components, and follows the MVVM pattern.

It has a neat and elegant design made for iOS and following HIG guidelines.
