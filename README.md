## About the Project

This project was built in **2022** during the *Native Mobile Applications* course — on my girlfriend’s Mac. 😄 It ended up being a surprisingly useful introduction to macOS development, especially since just a few months later I’d have to build a significantly bigger project on a Mac anyway (my notebook decided to give up on me).

To this day, I still consider **SwiftUI** one of the most convenient and fluent ways to build UI. Even after working with a bunch of other technologies—React/Vite, Flutter, native Android, and more, nothing has quite matched that its flow for me.

The app itself is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game. You can play locally against another player or challenge the computer with multiple difficulty levels. The application has multiple views with navigation, reusable components, and follows the **MVVM** pattern.

It has a neat and elegant design made for iOS that is written in accordance with the HIG guidelines.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

1. A **macOS** machine (or a macOS virtual machine)
2. **Xcode** installed from the App Store
3. An iOS **Simulator** (preferably an iPhone *Pro* model)

Once everything is set up, select your simulator and press the **Run** (▶) button in Xcode. The app will build and launch in the simulator.
